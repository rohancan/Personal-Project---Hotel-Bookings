Objective: Analyze hotel booking data to uncover patterns in cancellations, guest preferences, and customer demographics, and provide actionable recommendations for operational improvements.

Steps Taken:

1. Business Understanding: Focused on understanding trends in bookings, guest types, and meal plan preferences.
   
2. Data Understanding: Reviewed the dataset for patterns in cancellations and confirmed bookings.
   
3. Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed the data for visualization in Tableau.
   
4. Modeling: Created interactive dashboards:
  Line graph for monthly booking trends.
  Pie chart showcasing meal preferences.
  Bar chart summarizing the average composition of guests (adults, children, babies).
  
5. Evaluation: Insights revealed:
  Peak bookings occurred in 2020, with notable cancellations during specific months.
  96.81% of bookings were from new guests, with a smaller percentage from repeated guests.
  The most popular meal plan was "Bed and Breakfast" (77.32% of total bookings).
  
6. Deployment: Delivered actionable recommendations:
  Improve marketing efforts to convert new guests into repeated ones.
  Offer discounts for "Full Board" options to boost adoption.

7. Key Results:
   The analysis highlighted significant cancellation trends and guest behavior, allowing the hotel to address operational inefficiencies.
   Recommendations were made to target specific guest segments and improve customer satisfaction.

8. Conclusion: This project demonstrates the ability to analyze real-world datasets, derive meaningful insights, and communicate them effectively using Tableau. The interactive dashboard serves as a practical tool for decision-making.

9. Recommendation: The hotel should invest in targeted campaigns for new guests and implement loyalty programs to retain existing customers.
